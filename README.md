# HRTEM-Image-Processing
This repository is used to process HRTEM images of soot nanoparticles with Matlab

Use the 'FinalScript.m' file.
The only steps needed are specifying the picture name (variable = pic) and the resolution of the image.

To analyze multiple images at one time, the images and their corresponding region of interests need to be saved in the same directory. The ROI can be created in the 'FinalScript.m' file and saved from the workspace.

To visualize the results, use the 'GraphingResults.m' file
